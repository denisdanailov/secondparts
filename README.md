Note: Spring Boot Server App must be running before starting the client!

```
After starting the server you can install and run the client from the `frontend` folder:

1. `npm install` (installs the node modules and the TypeScript definition files)
2. `PORT=8081 npm start` 
3. Open `http://localhost:8081`
